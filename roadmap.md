# RoadMap

The roadmap lays out the planned features for Zeno Lend. These are all subject to change based on community feedback and governance discussions. Instead of fixed deadlines, we provide a list of priorities in order of priority, which allows us to more flexibly adapt to market trends without committing to a fixed schedule. While it is a priority list many are worked on in parallel so it doesn't necessarily indicate release order.

Items in the Exploring category are on the backburner or merely in the research or ideation phase.
